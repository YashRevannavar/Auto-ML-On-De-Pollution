# Auto-ML-On-De-Pollution
# PM10 Air Quality Prediction Project

This project focuses on PM10 air quality prediction using a combination of Machine Learning (ML) and AutoML techniques. It includes data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation notebooks.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `script/` : Contains Jupyter notebooks for various aspects of the project.
  - `AutoMLModels/` : Notebooks for AutoML models.
    - `automl01.ipynb`
    - `automl02.ipynb`
    - `automl03.ipynb`
    - `automl04.ipynb`
  - `dataProcessing/` : Notebooks for data processing.
    - `dataCleaning.ipynb`
    - `dataUnderstanding.ipynb`
    - `weatherData.ipynb`
  - `MLModels/` : Notebooks for traditional ML models.
    - `ml1.ipynb`
    - `ml2.ipynb`
- `functionsAll.py` : Python script containing custom functions used in notebooks.


## Usage

- Use the data processing notebooks to clean and understand the dataset.
- Explore different ML and AutoML models in the respective notebooks for PM10 prediction.
- Modify and experiment with the code to suit your specific use case.
